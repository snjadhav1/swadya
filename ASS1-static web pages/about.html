  <main><div class="card"><h1>About</h1><p>Digital Literacy Buddy is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between technology and people who find it difficult to use it—especially elders and non-tech-savvy individuals. The platform connects users seeking digital help with volunteers who are willing to assist them in completing everyday online tasks such as creating emails, using government portals, online payments, or using smartphones and apps.

Our goal is to make technology simple, accessible, and human-driven. Volunteers can communicate in multiple languages such as English, Hindi, and Marathi, ensuring that language is never a barrier.

The platform also provides an admin panel for managing user activity, support requests, and volunteer engagements, ensuring smooth operation and transparency.</p></div></main>
